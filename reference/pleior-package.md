# pleior: Pleiotropy Analysis for GWAS Data

The pleior package provides tools for identifying and analyzing
pleiotropic genetic variants in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
It includes functions for data loading, preprocessing, pleiotropy
detection, and visualization, enabling researchers to explore shared
genetic mechanisms across complex traits.
