We propose an R package called `pleior` designed to analyze pleiotropy
in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Pleiotropy occurs when a
single genetic variant influences multiple traits, offering insights
into shared biological pathways and disease relationships. This package
would enable users to identify, analyze, and visualize pleiotropic
associations, addressing the question of how genetic variants contribute
to multiple complex traits, such as Alzheimer’s disease and related
conditions.

Understanding pleiotropy is crucial for uncovering shared biological
mechanisms, explaining disease comorbidity, and identifying potential
therapeutic targets. However, existing tools for pleiotropy analysis are
often fragmented, focusing on specific aspects like detection or
visualization, and may lack user-friendly interfaces or integration with
functional annotations.

***Why It Matters?*** Recent research studies suggests that pleiotropy
is widespread in human genetics, with many genetic variants linked to
multiple diseases or traits. For example, the SNP (rs814573) is know to
be associated with Alzheimer’s disease, and other traits like myocardial
infarction and tyrosine measurement. Understanding these connections
could help explain why certain diseases co-occur (co-morbidity) to
identify potential targets and responses of treatment/drug based on
shared genetic predispositions with other known traits. *`pleior`*
provides a unified platform to explore these relationships, making it
easier to generate hypotheses and interpret results.

**How can we systematically identify and interpret pleiotropic genetic
variants across multiple complex traits to uncover shared biological
mechanisms, disease relationships, and potential therapeutic targets?**

This question is grounded in recent research highlighting the widespread
nature of pleiotropy. For example, a 2019 study in *Nature Genetics*
found that trait-associated loci cover over half the genome, with 90%
overlapping multiple traits. Similarly, studies like FactorGo (2023) and
PLACO (2020) emphasize the need for scalable, statistically robust
methods to characterize pleiotropy across thousands of traits.
*`pleior`* builds on these findings by providing a unified toolset to
explore pleiotropy in a practical, accessible manner.
